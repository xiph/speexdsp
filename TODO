For 1.2beta3:
Merge TriMedia stuff
Control delay in new AEC API.
packet dump
make sure speex_alloc() and speex_free() are exported properly
split misc.h into spx_types.h and spx_sys.h
remove misc.h
proper error reporting
get rid of floats in initialisation (make the lag window a const array)


Eventually:
Do VAD properly
Warning/error handling
--enable-{aec,preprocessor,jitter,resampler}

Optimisations
- Add restrict in a few places?
- enable 4x4 version of pitch_xcorr() at least on some archs?

Would be nice:
Implement wideband split as IIR instead of QMF?

Allocator override (speex_lib_ctl?)
Fixed-point:
  - VBR
  - encoder init (lag_window, lsp)
  - Jitter buffer
  - AGC
Denoiser:
  - Better noise adaptation
AGC:
  - Use median filtering instead of "non-linear mean"?

Standards
-Complete Speex RTP profile
-MIME type registration

ideas:
Peelable stream (double codebook, higher bands, stereo)
LPC from spectral domain
