<h1> Speex: Free Voice Coding</h1>
<br>
</center>



             <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/speex">The Speex project</a>
          aims  to build an open-source (LGPL) patent-free voice codec. Unlike 
  other codecs   like  MP3 and <a href="http://www.vorbis.org/">Ogg Vorbis</a>
     , Speex is specially   designed for compressing voice at low bit-rates 
 for  applications such as  voice over IP (VoIP). In some sense, it is meant 
 to  be complementary to the  Ogg Vorbis codec.             
<p>If you are interested in participating to the project, contact us at <a href="mailto:speex-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">
           speex-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>  or <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/speex-devel">
           join  our mailing list</a>. Right now, we are mostly looking for 
 developers     with signal processing and speech coding knowledge, as well 
 as people with    knowledge about patents in that field.<br>
            </p>

<h2>News</h2>



         
<h3>2002/04/15</h3>



     Speex version 0.0.2 has been released. This release provides much improved 
  wideband quality at an only slightly higher bit-rate of 31.3 kbps. This 
means  that the wideband Speex files are no compatible with those of the 0.0.1
release.  The narrowband codec (at 14.5 kbps) is however exactly the same
as in 0.0.1.    <br>



                     
<h3>2002/03/27</h3>



           Speex 0.0.1 has been released. This first version of Speex supports
   fixed   bit-rate encoding at 14.5 kbps for speech sampled at 8 kHz (narrowband) 
   and  at 28.5 kbps for 16 kHz (wideband) speech. Future releases will likely 
   provide  a wider choice of bit-rates, better quality, as well as variable 
   bit-rate  (VBR) and discontinuous transmission (DTX).<br>



           <br>



           Note that this is a preliminary release and that bit-rates, quality
   and   bitstream definition will change in the future. This means that
the    format   used in this release will not be compatible with future releases.
   Also note   that this software has so far received only a minimum amount
  of testing,  so it may break or do unexpected things.<br>

<h3>2002/03/12</h3>



           We now have a working encoder prototype that produces good quality 
  narrowband    (8 kHz sampling rate) at a bit-rate of 14.5 kb/s. There is 
 still a lot to   do, but we're progressing fast.<br>
