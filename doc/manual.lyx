Introduction to Speex
\layout Standard

The Speex project has been started because there was a need for a speech
 codec that was open-source and free from software patents.
 These are essential conditions for being used by any open-source software.
 There is already Vorbis that does general audio, but it is not really suitable
 for speech.
 Also, unlike many other speech codecs, Speex is not targeted at cell phones
 (not many open-source cell phones anyway :-) ) but rather voice over IP
 (VoIP) and file-based compression.
 
\layout Standard

As design goals, we wanted to have a codec that would allowed both very
 good quality speech and low bit-rate (unfortunately not at the same time!),
 which led us to developing a codec with multiple bit-rates.
 Of course very good quality also meant we had to do wideband (16 kHz sampling
 rate) in addition to narrowband (telephone quality, 8 kHz sampling rate).
\layout Standard

Designing for VoIP instead of cell phone use means that Speex must be robust
 to lost packets, but not to corrupted ones since packets either arrive
 unaltered or don't arrive at all.
 Also, the idea was to have a reasonnable complexity and memory requirement
 without compromising too much on the efficiency of the codec.
\layout Standard

All this led us to the choice of CELP as the encoding technique to use for
 Speex.
 One of the main reasons is that CELP has long proved that it could do the
 job and scale well to both low bit-rates (think DoD CELP @ 4.8 kbps) and
 high bit-rates (think G.728 @ 16 kbps).
 
\layout Standard

The main characteristics can be summerized as follows:
\layout Itemize

Free software/open-source, patent and royalty-free
\layout Itemize

Integration of wideband and narrowband in the same bit-stream
\layout Itemize

Wide range of bit-rates available
\layout Itemize

Dynamic bit-rate switching and variable bit-rate (VBR)
\layout Itemize

Voice Activity Detection (VAD, integrated with VBR)
\layout Itemize

Variable complexity

Introduction to CELP Coding
\layout Standard

Speex is based on CELP, which stands for Code Excited Linear Prediction.
 This section attempts to introduce the principles behind CELP, so if you
 are already familiar with CELP, you can safely skip to section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Speex-narrowband-mode}

\end_inset 

.
 The CELP technique is based on three ideas:
\layout Enumerate

The use of a linear prediction (LP) model to model the vocal tract
\layout Enumerate

The use of (adaptive and fixed) codebook entries as input (excitation) of
 the LP model
\layout Enumerate

The search performed in closed-loop in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

perceptually weighted domain
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 


\layout Subsection

Linear Prediction
\layout Standard

The linear prediction model represents each speech sample as linear combination
 of past samples, plus an error signal called the excitation (or residual).
\begin_inset Formula \[
x(n)=\sum _{i=1}^{N}a_{i}x(n-i)+e(n)\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

In the 
\emph on 
z
\emph default 
-domain, this can be expressed as
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
x(z)=\frac{1}{A(z)}\: e(z)\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

where 
\begin_inset Formula $A(z)$
\end_inset 

 is defined as
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
A(z)=1-\sum _{i=1}^{N}a_{i}z^{-i}\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

We usually refer to 
\begin_inset Formula $A(z)$
\end_inset 

 as the analysis filter and 
\begin_inset Formula $1/A(z)$
\end_inset 

 as the synthesis filter.
\layout Standard

The 
\begin_inset Formula $A(z)$
\end_inset 

 filter is computed using the Levinson-Durbin algorithm, which starts from
 the auto-correlation 
\begin_inset Formula $R(m)$
\end_inset 

 of the signal 
\begin_inset Formula $x(n)$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
r(m)=\sum _{i=0}^{N-1}x(i)x(i-m)\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

For an order 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

 filter, we have:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{R}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
 r(0) & r(1) & \cdots  & r(N-1)\\
 r(1) & r(0) & \cdots  & r(N-2)\\
 \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots  & \vdots \\
 r(N-1) & r(N-2) & \cdots  & r(0)\end{array}
\right]\]

\end_inset 


\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{r}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
 r(1)\\
 r(2)\\
 \vdots \\
 R(N)\end{array}
\right]\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The filter coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset 

 are found by solving the system 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Ra}=\mathbf{r}$
\end_inset 

.
 What the Levinson-Durbin algorithm does here is making the solution to
 the problem 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(N^{2}\right)$
\end_inset 

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(N^{3}\right)$
\end_inset 

 by exploiting the fact that matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset 

 is toeplitz hermitian.
 Also, it can be proved that all the roots of 
\begin_inset Formula $A(z)$
\end_inset 

 are withing the unit circle, which means that 
\begin_inset Formula $1/A(z)$
\end_inset 

 is always stable.
 This is in theory; in practice because of finite precision, there are two
 commonly used techniques to make sure we have a stable filter.
 First, we multiply 
\begin_inset Formula $r(0)$
\end_inset 

 by a number slightly above one (such as 1.0001), which is equivalent to
 adding noise to the signal.
 Also, we can apply a window the the auto-correlation, which is equivalent
 to filtering in the frequency domain, reducing sharp resonances.
\layout Standard

Because LPC coefficients have very little robustness to quantization, they
 are converted to Line Spectral Pair (LSP) coefficients which have a much
 better behaviour with quantization, one of them being that it's easy to
 keep the filter stable.
 
\layout Subsection

Pitch Prediction
\layout Standard

During voiced segments, the speech signal is very periodic, so it is possible
 to take advantage of that by expressing the excitation signal 
\begin_inset Formula $e(n)$
\end_inset 

 as
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
e(n)=\beta e(n-T)+c(n)\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

where 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset 

 is the pitch period, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta $
\end_inset 

 is the pitch gain and 
\begin_inset Formula $c(n)$
\end_inset 

 is taken from the 
\emph on 
innovation codebook
\emph default 
.
 In the 
\emph on 
z
\emph default 
-domain, the excitation can be expressed as:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
e(z)=\frac{1}{1-\beta z^{-T}}\: c(z)\]

\end_inset 


\layout Subsection

Innovation Codebook
\layout Standard

This is where most of the bits in a CELP codec are allocated.
 It represents the information that couldn't be obtained either from linear
 prediction or pitch prediction.
\layout Subsection

Analysis-by-Synthesis and Error Weighting
\layout Standard

Most (if not all) modern audio codecs attempt to 
\emph on 
shape
\emph default 
 the noise so that it is the hardest to detect with the ear.
 That means that more noise can be tolerated in parts of the spectrum that
 are louder and 
\emph on 
vice versa
\emph default 
.
 That's why the error is minimized for the perceptually weighted signal
\begin_inset Formula \[
X_{w}(z)=W(z)X(z)\]

\end_inset 

where 
\begin_inset Formula $W(z)$
\end_inset 

 is the weighting filter, usually of the form
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
W(z)=\frac{A\left(\frac{z}{\gamma _{1}}\right)}{A\left(\frac{z}{\gamma _{2}}\right)}\label{eq:weighting_filter}\end{equation}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

with control parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma _{1}>\gamma _{2}$
\end_inset 

.
 If the noise is white in the perceptually weighted domain, then in the
 signal domain its spectral shape will be of the form
\begin_inset Formula \[
A_{noise}(z)=\frac{1}{W(z)}=\frac{A\left(\frac{z}{\gamma _{2}}\right)}{A\left(\frac{z}{\gamma _{1}}\right)}\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

If a filter 
\begin_inset Formula $A(z)$
\end_inset 

 has (complex) poles at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset 

 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane, the filter 
\begin_inset Formula $A(z/\gamma )$
\end_inset 

 filter will have its poles at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}^{'}=\gamma p_{i}$
\end_inset 

, making it a flatter version of 
\begin_inset Formula $A(z)$
\end_inset 

.

Speex narrowband mode
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:Speex-narrowband-mode}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

This section looks at how Speex works for narrowband (
\begin_inset Formula $8\: \mathrm{kHz}$
\end_inset 

 sampling rate) operation.
 The frame size for this mode is 
\begin_inset Formula $20\: \mathrm{ms}$
\end_inset 

, corresponding to 160 samples.
 Each frame is also subdivided into 4 sub-frames of 40 samples each.
\layout Standard

Also many design decisions were based on the original goals and assumptions:
\layout Itemize

Minimizing the amount of information extracted from past frames (for robustness
 to packet loss)
\layout Itemize

Dynamically-selectable codebooks (LSP, pitch and innovation)
\layout Itemize

G.728-like fixed codebooks (without backward-adaptive grains because of patent
 issues)
\layout Subsection

LPC Analysis
\layout Standard

An LPC analysis is first performed on a (Hamming) window that spans all
 the current frame and half a frame in advance.
 The LPC coefficients are then converted to Line Spectral Pair (LSP), a
 representation that is more robust to quantization.
 The LSP's are considered to be associated to the 
\begin_inset Formula $4^{th}$
\end_inset 

 sub-frames and the LSP's associated to the first 3 sub-frames are linearly
 interpolated using the current and previous LSP's.
\layout Standard

The LSP's are encoded using 30 bits for higher quality modes and 18 bits
 for lower quality, through the use of a multi-stage split-vector quantizer.
 For the lower quality modes, the 10 coefficients are first quantized with
 6 bits and the error is then divided in two 5-coefficient sub-vectors.
 Each of them is quantized with 6 bits, for a total of 18 bits.
 For the higher quality modes, the remaining error on both sub-vectors is
 turther quantized with 6 bits each, for a total of 30 bits.
\layout Standard

The perceptual weighting filter 
\begin_inset Formula $W(z)$
\end_inset 

 used by Speex is derived from the LPC analysis and corresponds to the one
 described by eq.
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:weighting_filter}

\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma _{1}=0.9$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma _{2}=0.6$
\end_inset 

.
 We can use the unquantized 
\begin_inset Formula $A(z)$
\end_inset 

 filter since the weighting filter is only used in the encoder.
\layout Subsection

Pitch Prediction (adaptive codebook)
\layout Standard

Speex uses a 3-tap prediction for pitch.
 That is, 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \[
e(n)=\beta _{0}e(n-T-1)+\beta _{1}e(n-T)+\beta _{2}e(n-T+1)+c(n)\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

where 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset 

 is the pitch period and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta _{i}$
\end_inset 

 are the prediction (filter) taps.
 The period and quantized gains are determined in closed loop.
\layout Subsection

Innovation Codebook
\layout Standard

In Speex, the innovation signal is quantized using shape-only vector quantizatio
n (VQ).
 That means that the codebooks that are used represent both the shape and
 the gain at the same time.
 This save many bits that would otherwise be allocated for a separate gain
 at the price of a slight increase in complexity.
 Except for the absence of (backward-adaptive) gain, the technique used
 in Speex is similar to G.728 (LD-CELP).
 However since we do not have a low-delay constraint, the search can be
 made more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

global
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and make use of the whole information available for a sub-frame.
\layout Subsection

Bit allocation
\layout Standard

There are 7 different narrowband bit-rates defined for Speex, ranging from
 200 bps to 18.15 kbps, although the modes below 5.9 kbps should not be used
 for speech.
 The bit-allocation for each mode is detailed in table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:bits-narrowband}

\end_inset 

.
 Each frame starts with the mode ID encoded with 4 bits which allows a range
 from 0 to 15, though only the first 7 values are used (the others are reserved).
 The parameters are listed in the table in the order they are packed in
 the bit-stream.
 All frame-based parameters are packed before sub-frame parameters.
 The parameters for a certain sub-frame are all packed before the following
 sub-frame is packed.
 Note that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

OL
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the parameter description means the the parameter is an open loop estimation
 based on the whole frame.

\layout Standard

So far, no MOS (mean opinion score) subjective evaluation has been performed
 for Speex.
 In order to give an idea of the quality achivable with it, table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:quality_vs_bps}

\end_inset 

 presents my own subjective opinion on it.
 It sould be noted that different people will perceive the quality differently
 and that the person that designed the codec often has a bias (one way or
 another) when it comes to subjective evaluation.
 Last thing, it should be noted that for most codecs (including Speex) encoding
 quality sometimes varies depending on the input.

Perceptual enhancement
\layout Standard

This part of the codec only applies to the decoder and can even be changed
 without affecting inter-operability.
 For that reason, the implementation provided and described here should
 only be considered as a reference implementation.
 The enhancement system is devided in two parts.
 First, the synthesis filter 
\begin_inset Formula $S(z)=1/A(z)$
\end_inset 

 is replaced by an enhanced filter
\begin_inset Formula \[
S'(z)=\frac{A\left(z/a_{2}\right)A\left(z/a_{3}\right)}{A\left(z\right)A\left(z/a_{1}\right)}\]

\end_inset 

where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{2}$
\end_inset 

 depend on the mode in use and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{3}=\frac{1}{r}\left(1-\frac{1-ra_{1}}{1-ra_{2}}\right)$
\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $r=.9$
\end_inset 

.
 The second part of the enhancement consists of using a comb filter to enhance
 the pitch in the excitation domain.

Speex wideband mode (sub-band CELP)
\layout Standard

For wideband, the Speex approach uses a 
\emph on 
q
\emph default 
uadrature 
\emph on 
m
\emph default 
irror 
\emph on 
f
\emph default 
ilter (QMF) to split the band in two.
 The 16 kHz signal is thus divided into two 8 kHz signals, one representing
 the low band (0-4 kHz), the other the high band (4-8 kHz).
 The low band is encoded with the narrowband mode described in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Speex-narrowband-mode}

\end_inset 

 in such a way that the resulting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

embedded narrowband bit-stream
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 can also be decoded with the narrowband decoder.
 Since the low band encoding has already been described only the high band
 encoding is described in this section.
\layout Subsection

Linear Prediction
\layout Standard

The linear prediction part used for the high-band is very similar to what
 is done for narrowband.
 The only difference is that we use only 12 bits to encode the high-band
 LSP's using a multi-stage vector quantizer (MSVQ).
 The first level quantizes the 10 coefficients with 6 bits and the error
 is then quantized using 6 bits too.
\layout Subsection

Pitch Prediction
\layout Standard

That part is easy: there's no pitch prediction for the high-band.
 There are two reasons for that.
 First, there is usually little harmonic structure in this band (above 4
 kHz).
 Second, it would be very hard to implement since the QMF folds the 4-8
 kHz band into 4-0 kHz (reversing the frequency axis), which means that
 the location of the harmonics are no longer at multiples of the fundamental
 (pitch).
\layout Subsection

Excitation Quantization
\layout Standard

The high-band excitation is coded in the same way as for narrowband.
 
\layout Subsection

Bit allocation
\layout Standard

For the wideband mode, all the narrowband frame is packed before the high-band
 is encoded.
 The narrowband part of the bit-stream is as defined in table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:bits-narrowband}

\end_inset 

.
 The high-band follows, as described in table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:bits-wideband}

\end_inset 

.
 This also means that a wideband frame may be correctly decoded by a narrowband
 decoder with the only caveat that if more than one frame is packed in the
 same packet, the decoder will need to skip the high-band parts in order
 to sync with the bit-stream.

Programming with Speex (the libspeex API)
\layout Subsection

Encoding
\layout Standard

In order to encode speech using Speex, you first need to:
\layout LyX-Code

#include <speex.h>
\layout Standard

You then need to declare a Speex bit-packing struct
\layout LyX-Code

SpeexBits bits;
\layout Standard

and a Speex encoder state
\layout LyX-Code

void *enc_state;
\layout Standard

The two are initialized by:
\layout LyX-Code

speex_bits_init(&bits);
\layout LyX-Code

enc_state = speex_encoder_init(&speex_nb_mode);
\layout Standard

For wideband coding, 
\emph on 
speex_nb_mode
\emph default 
 will be replaced by 
\emph on 
speex_wb_mode
\emph default 
.
 In most cases, you will need to know the frame size used by the mode you
 are using.
 You can get that value in the 
\emph on 
frame_size
\emph default 
 variable with:
\layout LyX-Code

speex_encoder_ctl(enc_state,SPEEX_GET_FRAME_SIZE,&frame_size);
\layout Standard

Once the initialization is done, for every input frame:
\layout LyX-Code

speex_bits_reset(&bits);
\layout LyX-Code

speex_encode(enc_state, input_frame, &bits);
\layout LyX-Code

nbBytes = speex_bits_write(&bits, byte_ptr, MAX_NB_BYTES);
\layout Standard

where 
\emph on 
input_frame
\emph default 
 is a 
\emph on 
(float *)
\emph default 
 pointing to the beginning of a speech frame, 
\emph on 
byte_ptr
\emph default 
 is a 
\emph on 
(char *)
\emph default 
 where the encoded frame will be written, 
\emph on 
MAX_NB_BYTES
\emph default 
 is the maximum number of bytes that can be written to 
\emph on 
byte_ptr
\emph default 
 without causing an overflow and 
\emph on 
nbBytes
\emph default 
 is the number of bytes actually written to 
\emph on 
byte_ptr
\emph default 
 (the encoded size in bytes).
 Before calling speex_bits_write, it is possible to find the number of bytes
 that need to be written by calling 
\family typewriter 
speex_bits_nbytes(&bits)
\family default 
, which returns a number of bytes.
 
\layout Standard

After you're done with the encoding, free all resources with:
\layout LyX-Code

speex_bits_destroy(&bits);
\layout LyX-Code

speex_encoder_destroy(enc_state);
\layout Standard

That's about it for the encoder.
 
\layout Subsection

Decoding
\layout Standard

In order to encode speech using Speex, you first need to:
\layout LyX-Code

#include <speex.h>
\layout Standard

You then need to declare a Speex bit-packing struct
\layout LyX-Code

SpeexBits bits;
\layout Standard

and a Speex encoder state
\layout LyX-Code

void *dec_state;
\layout Standard

The two are initialized by:
\layout LyX-Code

speex_bits_init(&bits);
\layout LyX-Code

dec_state = speex_decoder_init(&speex_nb_mode);
\layout Standard

For wideband decoding, 
\emph on 
speex_nb_mode
\emph default 
 will be replaced by 
\emph on 
speex_wb_mode
\emph default 
.
 You can get that value in the 
\emph on 
frame_size
\emph default 
 variable with:
\layout LyX-Code

speex_decoder_ctl(dec_state, SPEEX_GET_FRAME_SIZE, &frame_size); 
\layout Standard

There is also a parameter that can be set for the decoder: whether or not
 to use a perceptual post-filter.
 This can be set by: 
\layout LyX-Code

speex_decoder_ctl(dec_state, SPEEX_SET_PF, &pf); 
\layout Standard

where pf is an int that with value 0 to have the post-filter disabled and
 1 to have it enabled.
\layout Standard

Again, once the decoder initialization is done, for every input frame:
\layout LyX-Code

speex_bits_read_from(&bits, input_bytes, nbBytes);
\layout LyX-Code

speex_decode(st, &bits, output_frame);
\layout Standard

where input_bytes is a 
\emph on 
(char *)
\emph default 
 containing the bit-stream data received for a frame, 
\emph on 
nbBytes
\emph default 
 is the size (in bytes) of that bit-stream, and 
\emph on 
output_frame
\emph default 
 is a 
\emph on 
(float *)
\emph default 
 and points to the area where the decoded speech frame will be written.
 A NULL value as the first argument indicates that we don't have the bits
 for the current frame.
 When a frame is lost, the Speex decoder will do its best to "guess" the
 correct signal.
\layout Standard

After you're done with the decoding, free all resources with:
\layout LyX-Code

speex_bits_destroy(&bits);
\layout LyX-Code

speex_decoder_destroy(dec_state);
\layout Subsection

Codec Options (speex_*_ctl)
\layout Standard

The Speex encoder and decoder support many options and requests that can
 be accessed through the 
\emph on 
speex_encoder_ctl
\emph default 
 and 
\emph on 
speex_decoder_ctl
\emph default 
 functions.
 These functions are similar the the 
\emph on 
ioctl
\emph default 
 system call and their prototypes are:
\layout LyX-Code

void speex_encoder_ctl(void *encoder, int request, void *ptr);
\layout LyX-Code

void speex_decoder_ctl(void *encoder, int request, void *ptr);
\layout Standard

The different values of request allowed are (note that some only apply to
 the encoder or the decoder):
\layout Description

SPEEX_SET_ENH** Set perceptual enhancer to on (1) or off (0) (integer)
\layout Description

SPEEX_GET_ENH** Get perceptual enhancer status (integer)

Mode queries
\layout Standard

Speex modes have a querry system similar to the speex_encoder_ctl and speex_deco
der_ctl calls.
 Since modes are read-only, it is only possible to get information about
 a particular mode.
 The function used to do that is:
\layout LyX-Code

void speex_mode_query(SpeexMode *mode, int request, void *ptr);
\layout Standard

The admissible values for request are (unless otherwise note, the values
 are returned through 
\emph on 
ptr
\emph default 
):
\layout Description

SPEEX_MODE_FRAME_SIZE Get the frame size (in samples) for the mode
\layout Description

SPEEX_SUBMODE_BITRATE Get the bit-rate for a submode number specified throught
 
\emph on 
ptr
\emph default 
.
\layout Subsection

Packing more than one frame per packet
\layout Standard

Sometimes it is desirable to pack more than one frame per packet (or other
 basic unit of storage).
 The proper way to do it is to call speex_encode 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

 times before writing the stream with speex_bits_write.
\layout Section
\pagebreak_top 
Formats and standards
\layout Standard

Speex can encode speech in both narrowband and wideband and provides different
 bit-rates.
 However not all features must be supported by a certain implementation
 or device.
 In order to be said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Speex compatible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 (whatever that means), an implementation must implement at least a basic
 set of features.
\layout Standard

At the minimum, all narrowband modes of operation MUST be supported at the
 decoder.
 This includes the decoding of a wideband bit-stream by the narrowband decoder
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

The wideband bit-stream contains an embedded narrowband bit-stream which
 can be decoded alone
\end_inset 

.
 If present, a wideband decoder MUST be able to decode a narrowband stream,
 and MAY either be able to decode all wideband modes or be able to decode
 the embedded narrowband part of all modes (which includes ignoring the
 high-band bits).
\layout Standard

For encoders, at least one narrowband or wideband mode MUST be supported.
 The main reason why all encoding modes do not have to be supported is that
 some platforms may not be able to handle the complexity of encoding in
 some modes.
\layout Subsection

RTP Payload Format
\layout Standard

Since Speex encoded frames already contain mode information, they can be
 sent without any other information in an RTP packet.
 If more than one frame is transmitted, no byte padding is performed at
 the end of frames, except the last one.
 The number of frames contained in each packet MUST be transmitted out-of-band.
 
\layout Subsection

Ogg file format
\layout Standard

Speex bit-streams can be stored in Ogg files.
 In this case, the first packet of the Ogg file contains the Speex header
 described in table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:ogg_speex_header}

\end_inset 

.
 All integer fields in the headers are stored as little-endian.
 The 
\family typewriter 
speex_string
\family default 
 field must contain the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
Speex
\family default 
\SpecialChar ~
\SpecialChar ~
\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

 (with 3 training spaces), which identifies the bit-stream.
 The next field, 
\family typewriter 
speex_version
\family default 
 contains the version of Speex that encoded the file.
 For now, refer to speex_header.[ch] for more info.
 The 
\emph on 
beginning of stream
\emph default 
 (
\family typewriter 
b_o_s
\family default 
) flag is set to 1 for the header.
 The header packet has 
\family typewriter 
packetno=0
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
granulepos=0
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

The second packet contains the Speex comment header.
 The format used is the Vorbis comment format described here: http://www.xiph.org/
ogg/vorbis/doc/v-comment.html .
 This packet has 
\family typewriter 
packetno=1
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
granulepos=0
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

The third and subsequant packets each contain one or more (number found
 in header) Speex frames.
 These are identified with 
\family typewriter 
packetno
\family default 
 starting from 2 and the 
\family typewriter 
granulepos
\family default 
 is the number of the last sample encoded in that packet.
 Le last of these packets has the 
\emph on 
end of stream
\emph default 
 (
\family typewriter 
e_o_s
\family default 
) flag is set to 1.

FAQ
\layout Subsection*

Vorbis is open-source and patent-free, why do we need Speex?
\layout Standard

Vorbis is a great project but its goals are not the same as Speex.
 Vorbis is mostly aimed at compressing music and audio in general, while
 Speex targets speech only.
 For that reason Speex can achieve much better results than Vorbis on speech,
 typically 2-4 times higher compression at equal quality.
\layout Subsection*

Ogg, Speex, Vorbis, what's the difference?
\layout Standard

Ogg is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

file format
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 for holding multimedia data.
 Vorbis is an audio codec that uses Ogg to store its bit-streams as files,
 hence the name Ogg Vorbis.
 Speex also uses the Ogg format to store its bit-streams as files, so technicall
y they would be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Ogg Speex
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 files (I prefer to call them just Speex files).
 One difference with Vorbis however, is that Speex is less tied with Ogg.
 Actually, if what you do is Voice of IP (VoIP), you don't need Ogg at all.
\layout Subsection*

Can I use Speex for compressing music?
\layout Standard

Just like Vorbis is not really adapted to speech, Speex is really not adapted
 for music.
 In most cases, you'll be better of with Vorbis when it comes to music.
\layout Subsection*

I converted some MP3's to Speex and the quality is bad.
 What's wrong?
\layout Standard

This is called transcoding and it will always result in much poorer quality
 than the original MP3.
 Unless you have a really good (size) reason to do so, never transcode speech.
 This is even valid for self transcoding (tandeming), i.e.
 If you decode a Speex file and re-encode it again at the same bit-rate,
 you will lose quality.
\layout Subsection*

Does Speex run on Windows?
\layout Standard

As of 0.8.0, Speex can now compile on Windows, though limited testing has
 been done so far.
\layout Subsection*

Why is encoding so slow compared to decoding?
\layout Standard

For most kinds of compression, encoding is inherently slower than decoding.
 In the case of Speex, encoding consists of finding, for each vector of
 5 to 10 samples, the entry that matches the best within a codebook consisting
 of 16 to 256 entries.
 On the other hand, at decoding all that needs to be done is lookup the
 right entry in the codebook using the encoded index.
 Since a lookup is much faster than a search, the decoder works much faster
 than the encoder.
\layout Subsection*

Why is Speex so slow on my iPaq (or insert any platform without an FPU)?
\layout Standard

Well the parenthesis provides the answer: no FPU (floating-point unit).
 The Speex code makes heavy use of floating-point operations.
 On devices with no FPU, all floating-point instructions need to be emulated.
 This is a very time consuming operation.
\layout Subsection*

I'm getting unusual background noise (hiss) when using libspeex in my applicatio
n.
 How do I fix that?
\layout Standard

One of the cause could be scaling of the input speech.
 Speex expects signals to have a 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm 2^{16}$
\end_inset 

 (signed short) dynamic range.
 If the dynamic range of your signals is too small (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm 1.0$
\end_inset 

), you will suffer important quantization noise.
 A good target is to have a dynamic range around 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm 8000$
\end_inset 

 which is large enough, but small enough to make sure there's no clipping
 when converting back to signed short.
\layout Subsection*

I get very distorted speech when using libspeex in my application.
 What's wrong?
\layout Standard

There are many possible causes for that.
 One of them is errors in the way the bits are manipulated.
 Another possible cause is the use of the same encoder or decoder state
 for more than one audio stream (channel), which produces strange effects
 with the filter memories.
 If the input speech has an amplitude close to 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{16}$
\end_inset 

, it is possible that at decoding, the amplitude be a bit higher than that,
 causing clipping when saving as 16-bit PCM.
\layout Subsection*

Can Speex pass DTMF?
\layout Standard

I guess it all depends on the bit-rate used.
 Though no formal testing has yet been performed, I'd say don't go below
 the 15 kbps mode if you want DTMF to be transmitted correctly.
 Also, make sure you don't use the lowest complexity (see SPEEX_SET_COMPLEXITY
 or --comp option), as it causes important noise.
\layout Subsection*

Can Speex pass V.9x modem signals correctly?
\layout Standard

If I could to that I'd be very rich by now :-)
\layout Subsection*

What is your (Jean-Marc) relationship with the University of Sherbrooke
 and how does Speex fit into that?
\layout Standard

I am currently (2002/08/13) doing a Ph.D.
 at the University of Sherbrooke in mobile robotics.
 Although I did my master with the Sherbrooke speech coding group (in speech
 enhancement, not coding), I am not associated with them anymore.
 It should 
\series bold 
not
\series default 
 be understood that they or the University of Sherbrooke endorse the Speex
 project in any way.
 Furthermore, Speex does not make use of any code or proprietary technology
 developed in the Sherbrooke speech coding group.
 
\layout Subsection*

CELP, ACELP, what's the difference?
\layout Standard

CELP stands for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Code Excited Linear Prediction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, while ACELP stands for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\emph on 
Algebraic
\emph default 
 Code Excited Linear Prediction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 That means ACELP is a CELP technique that uses an algebraic codebook represente
d as a sum of unit pulses, thus making the codebook search much more efficient.
 This technique was invented at the University of Sherbrooke and is now
 one of the most widely used form of CELP.
 Unfortunately, since it is patented, it cannot be used in Speex.

 PREAMBLE
\layout Standard

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written
 document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective
 freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
 commercially or noncommercially.
 Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
 to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
 modifications made by others.
\layout Standard

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works
 of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
 It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
 designed for free software.
\layout Standard

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software,
 because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come
 with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does.
 But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for
 any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published
 as a printed book.
 We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction
 or reference.
 
\layout Subsection*

1.
 APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
\layout Standard

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice
 placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms
 of this License.
 The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.
 Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".
\layout Standard

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
 or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
 translated into another language.
\layout Standard

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
 Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers
 or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
 matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
 subject.
 (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary
 Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter
 of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
 legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
 them.
\layout Standard

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
 designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
 that the Document is released under this License.
\layout Standard

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
 Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
 Document is released under this License.
\layout Standard

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented
 in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose
 contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic
 text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
 or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
 for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety
 of formats suitable for input to text formatters.
 A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been
 designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is
 not Transparent.
 A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
\layout Standard

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
 without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using
 a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed
 for human modification.
 Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be
 read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
 the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-ge
nerated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.
\layout Standard

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus
 such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
 License requires to appear in the title page.
 For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page"
 means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
 preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
\layout Subsection*

2.
 VERBATIM COPYING
\layout Standard

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
 or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices,
 and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are
 reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever
 to those of this License.
 You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or
 further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
 However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.
 If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
 the conditions in section 3.
\layout Standard

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
 may publicly display copies.
\layout Subsection*

3.
 COPYING IN QUANTITY
\layout Standard

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and
 the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
 copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
 Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
 cover.
 Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher
 of these copies.
 The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
 equally prominent and visible.
 You may add other material on the covers in addition.
 Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the
 title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
 copying in other respects.
\layout Standard

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
 you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
 actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
\layout Standard

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
 than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
 with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessib
le computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the
 Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public
 has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network
 protocols.
 If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when
 you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
 Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until
 at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly
 or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
\layout Standard

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document
 well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance
 to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
 
\layout Subsection*

4.
 MODIFICATIONS
\layout Standard

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
 conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
 Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling
 the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification
 of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
 In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: 
\layout Itemize

A.
 Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
 that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should,
 if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document).
 You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher
 of that version gives permission.
\layout Itemize

B.
 List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible
 for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with
 at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
 authors, if it has less than five).
\layout Itemize

C.
 State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,
 as the publisher.
\layout Itemize

D.
 Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
\layout Itemize

E.
 Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to
 the other copyright notices.
\layout Itemize

F.
 Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
 the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
 License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
\layout Itemize

G.
 Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
 required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
\layout Itemize

H.
 Include an unaltered copy of this License.
\layout Itemize

I.
 Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an
 item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
 Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
 If there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating
 the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its
 Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated
 in the previous sentence.
\layout Itemize

J.
 Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
 access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
 locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
 These may be placed in the "History" section.
 You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least
 four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of
 the version it refers to gives permission.
\layout Itemize

K.
 In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the
 section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone
 of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
\layout Itemize

L.
 Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
 text and in their titles.
 Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
 titles.
\layout Itemize

M.
 Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".
 Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
\layout Itemize

N.
 Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in
 title with any Invariant Section.
 
\layout Standard

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
 that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from
 the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections
 as invariant.
 To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
 Version's license notice.
 These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
\layout Standard

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
 but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
 statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization
 as the authoritative definition of a standard.
\layout Standard

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage
 of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover
 Texts in the Modified Version.
 Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
 added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.
 If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously
 added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
 behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on
 explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
\layout Standard

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
 permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorseme
nt of any Modified Version.
 
\layout Subsection*

5.
 COMBINING DOCUMENTS
\layout Standard

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License,
 under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided
 that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all
 of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections
 of your combined work in its license notice.
\layout Standard

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
 identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.
 If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different
 contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end
 of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of

 COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
\layout Standard

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
 released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
 License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
 the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
 verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
\layout Standard

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
 it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
 License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other
 respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
 
\layout Subsection*

7.
 AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
\layout Standard

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
 independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
 medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document,
 provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation.
 Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not
 apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document,
 on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative
 works of the Document.
\layout Standard

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
 of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire
 aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround
 only the Document within the aggregate.
 Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
\layout Subsection*

8.
 TRANSLATION
\layout Standard

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
 translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
 Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission
 from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some
 or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
 Invariant Sections.
 You may include a translation of this License provided that you also include
 the original English version of this License.
 In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original English
 version of this License, the original English version will prevail.
\layout Subsection*

9.
 TERMINATION
\layout Standard

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
 as expressly provided for under this License.
 Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document
 is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
 License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
 remain in full compliance.

10.
 FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
\layout Standard

 Free Documentation License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
 may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
\layout Standard

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
 If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
 "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following
 the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later
 version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundatio
n.
 If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you
 may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
 Foundation.
